# Fruit-Shelf-Life-Detector
This notebook builds a machine learning model using Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow Hub to detect the shelf-life of a fruit.

Problem
Identifying the shelf life of a fruit given an image of the fruit.

Data
The data we're using is from Kaggle titled 'fruit and vegetable dataset for Shelf life' by user 'sooraj kavumpadi'.

Evaluation
The evaluation will see a group of 20 custom images downloaded from the internet - and see if they come close to predicting the data trained by the model.

Features
Some information about the data:

We are dealing with images (unstructured data) so, its probably best that we use Deep Learning / Transfer Learning. There are 77 classes of shelf lives. There are ~1,850 images in the training set.
